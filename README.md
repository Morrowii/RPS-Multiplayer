# RPS-Multiplayer

A simple Rock-Paper-Scissors-style game that was developed to practice and demonstrate my skills, and hopefully provide a little fun too!

Enter a username to begin. Select a player from the list of online players and challenge them, or wait for another player to challenge you and accept their challenge.

Pick either sword (rock), shield (paper), or daggers (scissors) while your opponent does the same. When both players have made their choices, you will be notified if you won, lost, or tied the round, and your stats will be updated.

If you want to stop playing your current opponent, you can select their name from the list of online players again and click surrender.

Your stats will be saved to your username. When exiting and returning to the game, simply login with your same username, or enter a new one to start over.

Don't forget to chat with other players in the bottom-left corner!
